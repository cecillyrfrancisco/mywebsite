      <h1>MEET ME</h1>
      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p>My name is Cecilly—some call me “Cici.”</p>
      <p>
        I hope you get to know me a little bit better through this site: my travels,
        my faith transition, my professional aspirations, my love for all things Taylor Swift,
        my musings, and altogether just what makes me, ME.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome!</p>

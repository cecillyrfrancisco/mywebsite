    <h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <h2>Associate Manager, Institute for Organization Management, U.S. Chamber of Commerce</h2>
    <p><strong>Jan 2022 – Present</strong></p>
    <p>
      I began my journey with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in January 2022 on the 
      <a href="#">Institute of Organization Management team</a>. In this role I manage Institute Faculty, 
      Curriculum Committee, social media, fundraising and scholarships, and the Institute blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some samples of the social media I manage are the Institute 
      <a href="#">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="#">Instagram</a>, <a href="#">Facebook</a>, 
      <a href="#">Twitter</a>, and <a href="#">Blog</a>. From 2022, I championed increasing the audience 
      growth by 117% and engagement by 426%. I not only enjoy consuming, but also enjoy creating content.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also manage the 138 <a href="#">Faculty</a> members (industry professionals) who present at the four 
      annual Institute sites, organize, promote, and moderate <a href="#">webinars</a>, and coordinate across 
      as Faculty to provide weekly content for the Institute <a href="#">blog</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I am able to continue scratching the itch to be a recruiter by interviewing potential faculty members. By Fall 2022, I had interviewed 26 individuals for the position of Faculty.
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One aspect of my job I particularly enjoy is working as coordinator for both Fundraising and Scholarships. In 2022, $28,320 was raised between all four sites. These funds were used to fund the 80 scholarships awarded during 2022.</a>.

    <h2>Big Brothers Big Sisters</h2>
    <p><strong>Aug 2022 – Present</strong></p>
    <p>
      Years ago, I came across the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, and I immediately knew it was something I wanted to do. I was in a period of transition, then took on a full-time remote job and was bopping around working from coffeeshops and different states, so was in no position to volunteer (yet) with the program in the capacity I desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I made the move to DC in early 2022, I knew it was time. Once I got my feet under me and the busy summer schedule calmed down, I was matched with my little, H, and since then have enjoyed every minute of meeting up, chatting, and building a relationship to be a life mentor for her.

<!-- SECCIÓN: Barista, Starbucks -->

    <h2>Barista, Starbucks</h2>
    <p><strong>Feb 2022 – Dec 2022; Sep 2020 – May 2021</strong></p>
    <p>
      Because I was working remote and living alone during the pandemic, I found myself craving human interaction.
      So, I decided to try my hand at a skillset I’d always been interested in — being a barista.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working at Starbucks part-time on the weekends and during some weeknights has been a fun way to make new friends,
      learn a new skill, and, of course, help my budget a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s been rewarding to work at two locations — my first in St. George, UT and now working at a location here in D.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also recognize that I really respect Starbucks as a company in their efforts to improve when something
      <span class="highlight">isn’t handled correctly</span>, provide educational opportunities for its partners,
      and provide other benefits like free Spotify Premium (I do love my music), Headspace (because, #pandemiclife),
      and 20 free therapy sessions a year with Lyra (this honestly may be my favorite).
    </p>
    <p>
      What can I say? I love Starbucks
